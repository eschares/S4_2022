Files for the Science of Science Summer School (S4), organized by Syracuse University, [https://s4.scienceofscience.org/](https://s4.scienceofscience.org/)

Together with team member [cripp085](https://github.com/cripp085/S4_2022), this capstone project looks at the OpenAlex database and API.

We investigate cited references of publications (the Jupyter Notebook in this repository named `Schares_cited_references_in_OpenAlex`) and the availability of datasets (see [cripp085](https://github.com/cripp085/S4_2022) for more).
